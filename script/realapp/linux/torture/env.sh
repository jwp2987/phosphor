# realapp/linux/torture: seeded expert-typist fuzzer and XTest key sequencer (kseq.c, rec.c) with exact-received-command verification, run against Phosphor and a reference terminal.
# Platform: Linux X11. Prereqs: cc -O2 kseq.c rec.c -lX11 -lXtst; PHOSPHOR_DEB_DIR extracted deb; config.example.sh sourced.
# Run: run.sh / all.sh (scenarios in scen.py); lib.sh builds the scratch profile (owner-config copy, agent mode, LAN provider).
# Restores: scratch profile only; the owner's config is only read (copied) and never printed.
